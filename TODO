Critical

- attacker going forward just passes by most of the time
- volley to make pass against the wall

Major

- defender should not come out if any other ally is closer
- defender should stand facing the puck as quickly as possible, maybe far from the defense point
- improve behavior with puck near the enemy goal
- in the beginning, make a pass to the defender
- substitute defender sometimes in 2x6, e.g. swap him with midfielder at a safe moment

Normal

- find the safest path to go forward

Minor

- try sitting in the defense if winning
